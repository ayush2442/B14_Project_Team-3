What is Django?
    -> Free & Opensource framework for building web applications with python.

applications?
    -> we need to install separate technologies that are used for the projects
 
Why we need to use django?
    -> less codes
    -> less time to create and complete the project
 
Companies that are using django for their projects:
    -> Youtube

    -> DropBox
 
Advantages of using django:
    -> it will have a inbuilt admin site
    -> ORM (Object Relational Mapper)
        -> tool used to connect the programming code and database
    -> Authentication
    -> Caching/cookies
 
manage.py file
    -> is the main file for our djang project
    -> used to run the server for our project
 
settings.py file
    -> used to store some pre-required applications for our django project
    -> admin - have the admin access for our project
    -> auth - commands for our authentication purpose
    -> if you want to create a new app, then you need to link that app to our settings.py

    -> used for the navigation or routing methods
 
How to run the django project?

We have to create a sample web page in our django peoject.
1. we need to create a new application for our django project.
    -> because the apps which we are going to create, will act as the web page.
    -> in django, when we create a new web page, we can't create it directly, we need to create it as app.
 
To stop the server, press ctrl + C
 
    first we need to create a app in our django project
    -> to create a app, we need to use the admin command as 'startapp'
        django-admin startapp appname
 
        django-admin startapp demopage
inside that demopage, we will have lot of python files like main project folder
 
views.py file:
    used to display the web page or used to export the web page, which we have created to our main project folder 'sample'
    -> will have only functions inside it.
 
how to create a function in python:
    def functionName(arguments):
        statement
        return ->
 
2. We are create the web page with the help of html file.
    1. we need to create a new folder with the name 'templates' inside our demopage app.
    2. inside the templates folder, create a new file with the name as 'index.html'
    3. After creating the html file, fill your html tags and codes.
 
if you are going to start the html codes, we need to have from predefined structure of html page.
    1. type ! symbol and press enter or tab space
    2. fill the code
 
3. link the app folder and main project folder
    1. we need to complete the code in views.py
    2. inside views.py create a function with the name as 'home' with an argument called as 'request'.
    3. inside the function, return the web page, which you want to display as output.
        -> we need to use a function render(), this render function is used to open your web page as output.
        -> render() will have 2 arguments, one is request and another one is the web page name, which you want to open.
4. After filling the views.py code, jump to our main project folder.
    1. we are going to install our new app 'demopage' inside our main folder.
        -> we needs to open the settings.py
        -> go to installed_app and add your new app name at the last with comma
            'demopage',
    2. we need to create a url for our new html page
        -> we need to open urls.py
        -> go to urlspattern and create a new path for your new html page.
 
        syntax:
        path('urlname',function call to views.py,name of html page)
 
        path('',views.home,name='index')
 
        -> import the views from demopage
            from demopage import views
 
5. we can stop the server and re-run the server or we can reload the current server
 
As of now use internal css for styling
