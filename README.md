# **Advanced Skin Disease Diagnosis Leveraging Machine Learning**

## **OVERVIEW**

The **Advanced Skin Disease Diagnosis System** is an innovative solution that leverages the power of machine learning and image processing to provide precise and actionable insights into skin conditions. Designed as a user-friendly platform, it integrates secure user functionalities, advanced OpenCV techniques, and a robust voting ensemble model to enable real-time diagnosis from uploaded skin condition images. 

This project aims to bridge the gap between medical accessibility and technology by offering a diagnostic tool that is:
- **Accessible**: Provides initial diagnostic insights, especially for individuals in remote or underserved areas.
- **Accurate**: Utilizes machine learning to classify skin conditions with a high degree of precision, achieving 80% accuracy through an ensemble model.
- **User-Centric**: Features intuitive account management, secure image uploads, and detailed diagnostic displays.

Key features include:
- **Image Processing with OpenCV**: Enhances image quality, detects contours, and segments affected areas for a detailed analysis.
- **Voting Ensemble Model**: Combines Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost for reliable classification of skin conditions.
- **Dimensional Analysis**: Measures and displays the dimensions of affected areas for better understanding.
- **Real-Time Functionality**: Seamless integration of backend processing and frontend UI to deliver instant results.

This project is designed to empower users with technology-driven medical insights, supporting early diagnosis and encouraging timely medical intervention. By combining cutting-edge image processing techniques and machine learning models, the system showcases the potential of AI in revolutionizing healthcare accessibility and efficiency.
